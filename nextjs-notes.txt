=> run npm i @prisma/client (for client to interact with db)
=> create folder project/lib and create file prismadb.ts to configure prisma client and nextjs hot preloading
=> nextjs hot preloading is when code changes prisma is rerun again
=> due to nextjs hot preloading prisma creates multiple prisma client instances which generates error 'already prisma clients are actively running'
